Hostnet Dead File Color Plugin for Eclipse
This plug-in can be used to decorate the files
and directories in the navigator with a color
ranging from green to red depending on the value
in a colors.txt file.

This plug-in is created as companion for the
dead code identification tools for PHP but can
also be used with any other tool that creates
a colors.txt file.

If colors.txt is placed in the project root
it will be loaded automatically. The format
of the file is quite simple.

Every line contains a directory of file with
relative path to the project root folder. The
line starts with the percentage of dead / unused
files in the folder followed by a space and the
file path.

Example colors.txt:
25 /
50 app
50 app/blog
0 app/blog/category_app.php
100 app/blog/post_app.php
0 index.php
0 url.php

The toolbox to measure dead code and create color.txt
files can also be found at Hostnets GitHub Page.
